    <h3>Method</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the skirt steak on a large oven tray, season with salt flakes and drizzle with the sesame oil. Leave steak to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes or until the fridge chill has gone.
            </li><br>
            <li>Cook the udon noodles according to packet instructions, reserving 1 cup (250ml) of noodle water.
            </li><br>
            <li>Heat a lightly greased barbecue or chargrill pan over high heat. Grill the steak for 3-4 minutes on each side until cooked to your liking. Remove from the heat and rest, loosely covered with foil, for 10-12 minutes.
            </li><br>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat half the butter in a large non-stick frypan over medium-high heat. Add the mushroom and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden. Remove and set aside. Add the gochujang and tomato sauce to the pan and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes until the gochujang is lightly caramelised. Add the noodle water and bring to a simmer, cooking for 2-3 minutes until the liquid is slightly reduced.
            </li><br>
            <li>Add the noodles, spinach and remaining butter, and stir until spinach is wilted and noodles are coated in the sauce.
            </li><br>
            <li>Divide noodles among serving plates, top with sliced steak, broccolini, mushroom and nori. Sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve.
